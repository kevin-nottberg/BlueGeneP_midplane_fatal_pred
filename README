This code repo is for school a project in doing research on machine learning prediction using BlueGene/P RAS log data.

The code is messy and uncommented and needs work in terms of cleaning, but fundementally, it needs scikit-learn and a set of data publicly available at
the following url https://www.usenix.org/cfdr-data#bgp. 

Script order of execution:
log_spatial_filtering.py: reads in raw RAS log data and splits it into individual midplane files
log_temporal_filtering.py: does temporal record redundant filtering across all midplane files
fatal_seq_filtering.py: removes chains of FATAL events in RAS logs
fatal_sequence_extrction.py: creates and extracts FATAL sequences
non_fatal_sequence_extraction.py: creates and extracts non FATAL sequences
data_format.py: normalizes and puts data into vectors from sequence extraction. Also gets data in CSV format for scikit-learn
model_train_test.py: will run training and testing cycles to measure prediction accuracy with a support vector machine mode
