This code repo is for school a project in doing research on machine learning prediction using BlueGene/P RAS log data.

The code is messy and uncommented and needs work in terms of cleaning, but fundementally, it needs scikit-learn and a set of data publicly available at
the following url https://www.usenix.org/cfdr-data#bgp. 

Script order of execution:
log_filtering.py: reads in raw RAS log data and splits it into individual midplane files
